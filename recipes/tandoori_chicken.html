        <h1>Tandoori Chicken</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Tandoori Chicken</strong> is a popular dish where marinated chicken is grilled to
            perfection in a <em>Tandoor,a cylindrical clay oven</em>.Any kind of heat source is good 
            enough to grill/roast the chicken-an oven, stovetop,air fryer or direct fire.

        <p>
            The key to <em>Tandoori chicken</em> is to use bone-in thighs and legs
            because they have enough fat to stay moist under the heat of the grill.
            We don't recommend this dish with chicken breasts, they'll dry out too easily.
        
            The pieces should be skinless. Here's a trick though, if you find yourself with
            extra skins,soak them in the marinade and slowly fry them until crispy. Better than bacon.
