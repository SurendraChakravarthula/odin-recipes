        <h1>Hyderabad Dum Biryani</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Hyderabad Dum Biryani</strong> is a style of biryani from Hyderabad, 
            India made with <em>Basmati rice</em> and <em>meat</em> (mostly chicken). 
            Originating in the kitchens of the Nizam of Hyderabad, it combines elements 
            of Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines.

            <em>Hyderabad Dum Biryani</em> is not just a treat for the taste buds but for all the senses. 
            While the chicken or mutton is marinated in a variety of spices and aromatics that 
            lend their flavours to the final biryani dish, the rice also plays an important role in 
            bringing flavour to the biryani. And of course, the birista or fried onions, ghee, and saffron
            add their essence to the final dish.

        <p>Steps to prepare Hyderabad Dum Biryani:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise,
                 and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped.</li>
            <li>Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, chile powder, biryani masala powder, and turmeric in a large bowl. 
                Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until 
                rice is partially cooked through and still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, 
                about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and chile peppers; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
                 Carefully remove 1 tablespoon of ghee from the pot; set it aside.</li>
            <li>Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add to the pot. Cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side.
                Spread drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on top of the rice. Drizzle reserved ghee and saffron milk over onions and rice.            </li>
            <li>Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, 
                covered, until rice is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes.</li>
