        <p>
            <strong>Hyderabad Dum Biryani</strong> is a style of biryani from Hyderabad, 
            India made with <em>Basmati rice</em> and <em>meat</em> (mostly chicken). 
            Originating in the kitchens of the Nizam of Hyderabad, it combines elements 
            of Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines.

            <em>Hyderabad Dum Biryani</em> is not just a treat for the taste buds but for all the senses. 
            While the chicken or mutton is marinated in a variety of spices and aromatics that 
            lend their flavours to the final biryani dish, the rice also plays an important role in 
            bringing flavour to the biryani. And of course, the birista or fried onions, ghee, and saffron
            add their essence to the final dish.
